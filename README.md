## CODSOFT

This repository contains three Python programs developed in the Colab environment under the MIT license. Each program focuses on a different aspect of data science: Credit Card Analysis, Movie Recommendation System, and Advertisement Analysis.

## Programs Overview

1. **Credit Card Analysis**
   - This program analyzes credit card transaction data to provide insights into spending patterns, fraud detection, and customer behavior. It employs various statistical and machine learning techniques to extract valuable information from the data.

2. **Movie Recommendation System**
   - The Movie Recommendation System utilizes collaborative filtering techniques to recommend movies to users based on their past preferences and similarities with other users. It employs algorithms such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or Alternating Least Squares (ALS) to generate personalized recommendations.

3. **Advertisement Analysis**
   - The Advertisement Analysis program analyzes the effectiveness of advertising campaigns by examining metrics such as click-through rates, conversion rates, and customer demographics. It utilizes data visualization techniques and predictive modeling to optimize advertising strategies.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow (for recommendation system), Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.

## Usage
1. **Credit Card Analysis**
   - Open the `Credit_Card_Analysis.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab or any Jupyter environment.
   - Upload your credit card transaction dataset or use the provided sample dataset.
   - Follow the instructions and run the cells to perform analysis and generate insights.

2. **Movie Recommendation System**
   - Open the `Movie_Recommendation_System.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab or any Jupyter environment.
   - Provide the movie ratings dataset (e.g., MovieLens dataset) or use the provided sample dataset.
   - Execute the cells to train the recommendation model and generate movie recommendations for users.

3. **Advertisement Analysis**
   - Open the `Advertisement_Analysis.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab or any Jupyter environment.
   - Input your advertisement campaign data or use the provided sample dataset.
   - Run the cells to analyze the effectiveness of the advertising campaigns and visualize the results.
